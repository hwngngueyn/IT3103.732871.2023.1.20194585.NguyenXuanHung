Question 1: Add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
Answer 1 : This case is an array parameter.

Question 2: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 
●Pass by value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed to the method. That's why it's called pass by value 
●Pass by reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method. That's why it's called pass by reference.
Answer 2 : JAVA is always a pass by value
